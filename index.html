                <p>I am a native Dallasite with degrees in English and Geology. Since all 
                    of the jobs teaching rocks proper grammar were taken, I have turned to 
                    full stack web development for a sense of job satisfaction. I love cats,
                        I like people, and I want to make the world a nicer place. I also hate to 
                    talk about myself. A lot.</p>


                <p>Likes: Chaucer and micaceous schist. Dislikes: Hemingway and anthracite.</p>

                        If there are, we all be dead. Well, I'm not saying I'd like to build a summer home here, but 
                        the trees are actually quite lovely. And YOU: friendless, brainless, helpless, hopeless! Do 
                        you want me to send you back to where you were? Unemployed, in Greenland? No, there is too 
                        much. Let me sum up. Buttercup is marry' Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour. So 
                        all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the princess, make our escape... 
                    after I kill Count Rugen. You seem a decent fellow... I hate to kill you. Naturally... but 
                        I find that Thibault cancels out Capa Ferro. Don't you?
